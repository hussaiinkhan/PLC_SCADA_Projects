# ‚öôÔ∏è Motor Speed Monitoring & Analysis ‚Äì Ignition SCADA + MySQL

This project demonstrates a **real-time SCADA system** built using **Ignition SCADA** to monitor, store, and analyze **motor speed (RPM)** with a **MySQL database** backend. The system provides dynamic updates, visualization, and analytical insights through charts and tables.

---

## üìã Project Overview

- **Motor Speed Range:** 0 to 100 RPM
- **Speed is stored** in a MySQL database along with a timestamp each time it is changed.
- The system fetches **real-time and historical speed data** to calculate:
  - Current speed
  - Average speed
  - Minimum speed with timestamp
  - Maximum speed with timestamp
- Data is visualized through:
  - Easy chart (time-based trends)
  - Pie chart (speed distribution)
  - Bar chart (comparative analysis)
  - Data Table (for detailed records)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Flow

1. **Speed Input**  
   Operator can vary the motor speed using a slider/input (0‚Äì100 RPM).  

2. **Data Logging**  
   On every change:
   - The new speed is logged into a **MySQL database**
   - Timestamp is recorded for historical tracking

3. **Data Retrieval & Analysis**
   - Data is queried from MySQL using named queries or scripting
   - System calculates:
     - Current Speed
     - Average RPM
     - Minimum RPM (with timestamp)
     - Maximum RPM (with timestamp)

4. **Visualization**
   - **Easy Chart** shows real-time trends of motor speed
   - **Pie Chart** shows distribution (e.g., time spent in each speed range)
   - **Bar Chart** shows comparative speeds
   - **Table** displays exact data with timestamps

5. **Dynamic Interface**
   - All components update in real-time when speed changes
   - Useful for demo and operator visualization
