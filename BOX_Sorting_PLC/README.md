# üß± Box Sorting System using Ladder Logic (PLC)

This project is a complete **industrial simulation** of a PLC-based automated box sorting system, implemented entirely in **Ladder Logic (LD)** using OpenPLC. It demonstrates key skills in **PLC programming**, **sensor-based logic**, **conveyor automation**, and **industrial counting and alarm systems**‚Äîwithout using an HMI or SCADA interface.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate a **smart, sensor-based box sorting system** that can:

- Automatically classify boxes based on size
- Trigger conveyors to route boxes accordingly
- Count each type of box
- Raise alarms when a set threshold is reached

The project uses **pure ladder logic** to replicate how physical sensors and actuators behave in a factory-like environment. All logic, control, and visualization are handled programmatically using OpenPLC, showcasing strong fundamentals in PLC system design.

## üîß System Description

The system mimics a **box sorting conveyor line** that classifies boxes into small, medium, and large sizes based on simulated sensor inputs. Based on box size, each is routed to a dedicated conveyor (left, middle, or right). It keeps track of how many boxes of each type have been sorted, and activates an alarm when 15 boxes of any type are processed.

### üéõ Control Logic Flow:

1. **Start/Stop Controls**:
   - Pressing the `Start` button energizes the main conveyor (`main_conveyer`).
   - `Stop` halts the entire operation immediately.

2. **Box Simulation using Sensors**:
   - The `pulse` signal initiates the timing logic, activating virtual sensors (`sensor1`, `sensor2`, `sensor3`) after defined intervals.
   - Sensor logic:
     - **Small Box:** Only `sensor1` triggers
     - **Medium Box:** `sensor1` + `sensor2` trigger
     - **Large Box:** All three sensors trigger

3. **Conveyor Routing**:
   - **Small Box ‚Üí** `left_conveyer` activated
   - **Medium Box ‚Üí** `middle_conveyer` activated
   - **Large Box ‚Üí** `right_conveyer` activated

4. **Counting and Alarms**:
   - Each box type is counted using separate integer counters:
     - `small_boxes`, `middle_boxes`, `large_boxes`
   - When the count of any type reaches **15**, its corresponding alarm is triggered:
     - `small_boxes_alarm`, `middle_boxes_alarm`, `large_boxes_alarm`

5. **Reset Logic**:
   - Pressing the `reset` button resets all counters and alarms.

## ‚è± Timers & Simulation Logic

- **On-delay timers** simulate time-based triggering of sensors, as if boxes are arriving on the main conveyor at regular intervals.
- All conveyor switching logic is based on evaluating which combination of sensors is triggered.
